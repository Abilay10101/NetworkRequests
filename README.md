# NetworkRequests

In this project, I dismantled the main URLSession stack, its main classes and methods, and learned how to create network sessions with various tasks. I learned how to work with images on the web, receive data in JSON format and decode them into my own data structure. Also did the same functions on Alamofire

## General 
- Alamofire
- URLSession
- WEBKit
- UIKit
